.............WHAT IS INGERITANCE IN C++............

1. The concept of Reusability in C++ is supported using Inheritance.
2. We can reuse the properties of existing class bu inheriting from it 
   the existing class is called as the Base class (Parent Class).
3. The new class which is inherited is called as teh Derived class (Child Class).
4. Reusing classes saves time and money.
5. There are different types of inheritancce in C++.

///////////// FORMS FO INGERITANCE IN C++ /////////////////

1. Singel Inheritance -> A derived class with only one Base Class.

2. Multiple Inheritance -> A derived class with more than one Base Classes.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance -> Several (more than one) derived classes from a singel base class.

4. Multilevel Inheritance -> Deriving a class from already derived class.

5. Hybrid Inheritance -> is a combinatio of Hierarchical inheritancce and and Multilevel inheritance.
                         A class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritancce.
                         However, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
